# Chirpy

## Introduction

This is a project where I attempt to build a webserver using go. The design is supposed to be similar to twitter with users who can post `chirps' that are less than 140 characters long.

 I learnt many things like authentication, authorization, data storage and how to build RESTful APIs during this project.
